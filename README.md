# Election_Analysis1

## Project Overview
Tom, a Colorado Board of Elections employee has given us the task of completeing an analysis of an election audit of a recent congressional election.
We were tasked with:
- Finding the total number of votes cast.
- Getting a complete list of candidates who recieved votes
- Calculate the total votes per candidate
- Calculate the percentage of votes obtained per candidate
- Determine the winner by popular vote

## Resources
- Data: election_results.csv
-Software: Python 3.10, VS Code 1.38.1

## Summary
The analysis of the election shows that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast during this election
- The Candidates and results of the votes
  - Charles Casper Stockham, 23% of vote with 85,213 ballots.
  - Diana DeGette, 73.8% of vote with 272,892 ballots.
  - Raymon Anthony Doane, 3.1% of vote with 11,606 ballots.
- The winner of the election was:
  - Diana DeGette who recieved 73.8% of the vote with 272,892 votes.

## Challenges
The main challenge I ran into on this analysis was Name Errors. As long as I keep the names of the variables that I use clear then I shouldn't run into any issues.
